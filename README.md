# README.md Generator

This is a command line application that prompts the user with a number of questions. The answers to these questions will populate the corresponding sections of a README. The user is also asked to pick one of 4 different licenses that they wish to use in their README. The badge for the chosen license will render at the top of the README, and the name and link of the license will render in the license section of the README. If no license is chosen, no badge will be displayed at the top of the document, and no license section will be rendered inside the document.
